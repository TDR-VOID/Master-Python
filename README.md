# Master-Python

Welcome to the **Master-Python** repository! This repository documents my journey to mastering Python, from the basics to advanced concepts, and includes my exploration of Machine Learning.

## Repository Overview

This repository is organized into the following sections:

1. **Introduction to Python**: Basics of Python, including variables, data types, and basic operations.
2. **Control Flow**: Conditionals, loops, and logical operators.
3. **Functions**: Writing reusable code with functions, including lambda functions and higher-order functions.
4. **Data Structures**: Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
5. **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and more.
6. **Advanced Topics**: Modules, file handling, exceptions, decorators, generators, and context managers.
7. **Introduction to Machine Learning**: Basics of machine learning, including popular libraries and basic algorithms.


## Learning Path

I am following a structured learning path outlined in a comprehensive [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGN28LY5VuA&list=PPSV) on "Python for Data Science". While some of the content here is my own, the learning path and structure are inspired by this excellent series.
